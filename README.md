# ðŸ“ŒEDA on Agriculture in India
## ðŸ“•Description
Data Analysis State-wise Crop Production in India at kaggle for 1997 to 2015.

In this project, we are going to find insights and patterns and crop prediction using machine learning.
This dataset's exploratory data analysis could provide information about the state of Indian agriculture at the state, district, crop, and area levels as well as the level of production. A thorough investigation will tell a wonderful tale of this significant Indian feature.

## ðŸ‘‘Findings
(i) Production wise top zone is South zone with Kerala topping it's high crop production.

(ii) Production wise top crop type are Coconut, Sugarcane and Rice.

(iii) Total Production hit peak in the year 2011 and 2013.

(iv) Top crop categories which shows high production values are Whole Year(Annual growing plants),Kharif and Rabi crops. It clearly shows these crops heavily dependent on seasonal monssons.

(v) Top crop categories are Cereal, Pulses and Oilseeds.

(vi) Top producing state Kerela shows a abundance of whole year seasonal crops. Top producing state Uttar Pradesh shows abundance of Kharif, Rabi and Summar crops.

(vii) Top Crop Categories are Cereal(27.5), Pulses(17.8) and oilseeds(14.7) and these crops contribute towards 60% of total crop production.

## ðŸ‘‘Trend Analysis
(i) Variety of Crops have increased during 1997 to 2003 and have decreased afterwards. In the year 2015 there is a certain downfall in the number of various Crops.

(ii) The graphic suggests that, with a value of 35000, the agriculture area is the greatest during the winter. We can also deduce that there is relatively little agricultural throughout the summer.

(iii) The production in 2011 is highest then there is downward trend on production. In 2015 the production goes below what was in 1997

(iv) According to the visualisation, the agricultural area peaked in size in 1997, and starting in the year 2000, we can clearly notice a sharp fall in the agricultural area. After 2015, the region has continued to deteriorate.

## ðŸ‘‘Conclusion
Indian agriculture started a decline in the trend of food production because: 
(i) More and more land is being used for the development of factories, warehouses, and shelters; this has decreased the amount of land under cultivation. 
(ii) Pesticides, fertilisers, excessive irrigation, etc. all deteriorate soil, which causes salinity and water logging.

Remedial Measures: 
(i) Adoption of ecologically friendly agriculture methods is one of the corrective measures. 
(ii) Using biotechnology to alter various crops and boost yields per hectare. It also uses less water and lessens the need for pesticides.
