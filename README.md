# EDA on Agriculture in India
BI is on the lookout for new ways to save costs while making few or no sacrifices and it wants to optimise earnings. Farms can make greater use of their data by
implementing BI systems. Making data-driven decisions, gaining a competitive advantage, and improving forecasts are all things that can be done using data. 
It helps to create an agri-tech network. BI may use data from prior years to improve planning and prevent having to start from scratch with each new production cycle. 
The ability of information and knowledge development for assisting decision making has been proved by Business Intelligence (BI) technologies with the Extract, Transform, and Loading process, Data Warehouse, and Power BI. In this project, we are going to find insights and
patterns using BI tools and crop prediction using machine learning.
